## Hi!

Welcome to my personal website! I hope you like what you see. I built this website with Netlify, Hugo, and GitHub! It took me some time to get familiar with the setup, but here it is. I'm planning on uploading my personal projects to this site, as well as anything I think might be relevant!

I still need to figure out what "relevant" means, because I've got quite a few things that I'm interested in! I plan on using this website to supplement my job applications, though, so I figure it'll be a bunch of stuff related to my data analytics experiences, as well as any tech-y projects I'm working on.

Below is the licensing information for the theme & website building software that I used to design this site. I feel bad for deleting it, because of how much I love it!
