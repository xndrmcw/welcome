It's not particularly difficult to create visualizations, but, from what I hear, it's pretty tricky to make good ones! That being said, I'm pretty proud of this one! It was a bit of a force to get together. I'll walk through the steps I had to take to get to this point below! Even though there were some obstacles, it was a blast, and I recommend it to anyone looking to create a fun little viz project.

Before you say it, I know! Fitbit provides a similar visualization in their own app. What they <b>don't</b> do (for a reason I'm still not sure of) is allow you to download your heartrate data in a csv format! My initial goal with this project was to get familiar with animated visualizations, and I figured that creating a pulsing heartrate graph would be pretty sweet.

I couldn't find anything on the fitbit forums about downloading heartrate data. My guess is that HR data is pretty hard to come by, so maybe they don't want to just give it out willy-nilly. I dunno. It's kind of a bummer, though! Fortunately, I found a fantastic resource that does exactly what I was hoping for!
