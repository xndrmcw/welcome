## It's been a while! The last semester of college has been filled with unexpected surprises;

## a two week full lockdown, a broken bike, and a lot more.

## ^^That list reads like something out of the song "Read My Mind" by The Killers, hahaha. Anyways, I'm trying to get back on the horse! It's too easy to slack.

## RStudio is so much fun to play with. I was reading Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's blog post about her foray into generative art using the `jasmines` package, and it looked awesome, so I gave it a shot! Really fun to play with this package. I feel like an artist!!!

## Take a look at some of the pieces I put together!

## Boop! The accompanying `code`...

        install.packages("scico")     # Colour palettes based on the scientific colour-maps
        install.packages("TSP")       # Travelling salesperson problem

        ggsave("gen_5.png", device = "png", width = 5, height = 5, type = "cairo", dpi = 300)


        # cool grid function makes a 3x3

## Awesome! So glad I found this amazing package.
