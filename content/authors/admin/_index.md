Hi, I'm Alexander! I'm a recent graduate of Bentley University, where I just wrapped up my bachelor's degree in Data Analytics. My senior capstone focused on natural language processing using RStudio, and it was a great learning experience. If you'd like to learn more about it, a link to a full PDF can be found below!

During my last semester, I was also research affiliate at M.I.T., where I used Google BigQuery to pull data from a large hospital dataset. Under professor Reagan Mozer, my capstone advisor, I also learned to clean + pre-process the aforementioned text data using RStudio. Now that I'm graduated, I'm looking for a role that allows me to exercise my quantitative and qualitative strengths at a company which fosters growth in its employees and rewards dedication and diligence.
